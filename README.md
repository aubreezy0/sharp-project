The Sharp Project API README.

The Sharp Project API was built to support The Sharp Project, a crowd-sourcing tool for browsing and contributing glass project ideas, including a difficulty level for ease of project choice. Due to its complexity I was especially methodical about setting up the back end, and did several revisions of ERD.

Early versions of my ERD were very complex. With the help of instructors I was able to whittle it down for MVP. The ERD for the show project represents a one to many relationship, with users being able to view all projects, and add many projects, but each of those projects has just one owner who can modify the projects.

As mentioned in my client readme, this project has a lot of potential for making useful information available to a wider audience. Doing so would require introducing a join table of more information, and further careful planning with ERDs.
